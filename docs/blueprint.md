## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to evoke a sense of trust and community.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white but a hint of depth to provide contrast to content elements.
- Accent color: Muted violet (#8A2BE2) to represent sympathy, providing contrast with the primary teal.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font with a modern, neutral feel, for good readability.
- Use clean, simple icons for navigation and key actions. Icons should use the primary teal and violet accent colors.
- Maintain a clean, card-based layout with clear sections for key data. Use whitespace to enhance readability.
- Implement subtle animations, like fade-ins and transitions, to acknowledge actions and provide visual feedback without overwhelming the user.
